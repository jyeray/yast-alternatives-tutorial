<h2>A first mockup</h2>

<h3>Adding some widgets</h3>
<p>
At this point, our first YaST module does not look very impressive. It's time to
start adding some widgets to it in order to have a proper mockup of the user
interface. Let's take a look to what we need:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a table to display the log entries,</li>
  <li>some radio buttons to select which boot,</li>
  <li>some check-boxes to enable and disable filters,</li>
  <li>a button to refresh the entries table when the filters change,</li>
  <li>last but not least, a button to quit.</li>
</ul>
<p>
That sounds challenging enough for a newbie, let's go for it!
</p>
<p>
From all the useful links that can be found in the &quot;graphical
interface&quot; section of
<a href="http://yast.github.io/documentation.html">the YaST documentation</a>
home page, the
<a href="https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/YaST/openSUSE11.3/tdg/Book-YCPUIlayout.html">UI
layouts and events guide</a> is probably the best starting point to fully
understand how everything works and fits. But sometimes the best shortcut for
learning is some example code and
<a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-ycp-ui-bindings/tree/master/examples">this
URL</a> is packed with nice examples of the usage of libYUI widgets from Ruby.
</p>

<h3>Taking a look to the code</h3>
<p>
After having a look to the abovementioned documentation, feel free to start
modifying MockupDialog yourself. When you are done (or right away if you are
impatient), check the proposed example.
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
git checkout first_mockup
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Only one file (mockup_dialog.rb) has changed when compared to the previous git
tag. The &quot;run&quot; method is now slightly more complex and it includes a
rudimentary event loop.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
# Displays the dialog
def run
  return unless create_dialog

  begin
    return event_loop
  ensure
    close_dialog
  end
end

# Simple event loop
def event_loop
  loop do
    input = Yast::UI.UserInput
    if input == :cancel
      # Break the loop
      break
    else
      log.warn "Unexpected input #{input}"
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
For developers coming from more classical GUI toolkits like Gtk or
Qt, the need to write an event loop can look strange. As opposed to those
toolkits, libYUI is not event-driven because that approach does not completely
fit the typical YaST application work-flow. Just in case you wonder, in the next
step of this tutorial a second dialog will be added to our module and then
you'll see a clear example of such a typical YaST dialog (not event-driven).
</p>
<p>
The other interesting method is &quot;create_dialog&quot; in which the content
passed to Yast::UI.OpenDialog has changed from the simplistic label of the
previous example to a full tree of widgets (YaST terms created using the UI
shortcuts, if you remember) with a vertical box as the root node.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
# Draws the dialog
def create_dialog
  Yast::UI.OpenDialog(
    Opt(:decorated, :defaultsize),
    VBox(
      # Header
      Heading(_("Journal entries")),

      # Boot selector
      Frame(
        _("Log entries for"),
        boot_widget
      ),
      VSpacing(0.3),

      # Filter checkboxes
      Frame(
        _("Filters"),
        filters_widget
      ),
      VSpacing(0.3),

      # Refresh
      Right(PushButton(Id(:refresh), _("Refresh"))),
      VSpacing(0.3),

      # Log entries
      table,
      VSpacing(0.3),

      # Quit button
      PushButton(Id(:cancel), Yast::Label.QuitButton)
    )
  )
end
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Checking the result in ncurses</h3>
<p>
Reading code is always interesting, but you actually want to check how it looks
in the user's screen. You already know you can to it with:
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
Y2DIR=src/ /usr/sbin/yast2 mockup
{% endhighlight %}
<p>And this is what you get.</p>
<img class="centered" src="assets/images/step2-qt.png">
<p>
If you are not specially picky, the graphical interface looks acceptable. It's
quite cluttered but still useful. Sure there are some layout issues but you
think they could be fixed with no much work. After all, you have decided to
start writing a YaST module from scratch, so sure you are an optimistic person.
</p>
<p>
But there is something you should never forget when developing a YaST module - it
has to work properly with ncurses in a resolution of 80 columns and 25 lines.
So the next step is to resize your terminal emulator to a size of 80x25 and run:
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
Y2DIR=src/ /usr/sbin/yast2 --ncurses mockup
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The result looked far from perfect in graphical mode, but with ncurses and a
size of 80x25 it looks almost catastrophic. Very little space is left for the
log entries, which is the most relevant part. Needless to say, it will become
even worst if we add more filters in the future.

<h3>Let's try again</h3>
<p>
From the previous screenshot, it's obvious that we need to rethink our user
interface to avoid having everything in one single dialog. Time for the
<a href="step3.html">next step</a>.
