<h2>Combining several dialogs</h2>

<h3>Splitting the interface</h3>
<p>
Now that we have learned how precious the screen space is in YaST dialogs,
the obvious next step is to split the widgets in 2 different dialogs. The
solution proposed in this tutorial uses one dialog to display the log entries
-with some additional live filtering capabilities- and a second one containing
all the controls that we need for fine-tuning the filters. A picture is
worth a thousand words.

For a better understanding of the interface, simply checkout the corresponding
revision in the git local copy and play with it.

git checkout two_dialogs_mockup

<h3>The entries dialog</h3>
<p>
Checking the code you can see that our MockupDialog class is now split into
EntriesDialog and QueryDialog. The first one is starting to be quite
interactive, with a search box intended to allow filtering in &quot;real
time&quot; and a button to launch the other dialog, in addition to the
previously available buttons to refresh and quit. Let's take a look to the
event loop.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
def event_loop
  loop do
    case Yast::UI.UserInput
    when :cancel
      # Break the loop
      break
    when :filter
      if QueryDialog.new.run
        log.info "The user has set new arguments for the query"
      else
        log.info "The user canceled the query dialog"
      end
    when :search
      log.info "Handling of the search text input not implemented yet"
    when :refresh
      log.info "Handling of the refresh button not implemented yet"
    else
      log.warn "Unexpected input #{input}"
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Now if the user clicks on the &quot;change filter&quot; button a new dialog will
be opened on top of the queries dialog. That new dialog will handle the
interaction with the user until it's closed. In that moment, it will return a
value to EntriesDialog which will be again in charge of handling the user
interaction.
</p>
<p>
The other interesting bit of the new event loop is the existence of a new type
of user input labeled as :search. By monitoring the YaST log file, you can see
that it happens every time the user modifies the content of the input field with
the corresponding identifier. This is not the first time we use an input field
in our interface, but it's the first time we notice that kind of events. What
makes this input field different from the others? As expected, the answer is in
our code. This is an excerpt from the &quot;create_dialog&quot; method.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
HBox(
  Label(_("Displaying entries with the following text")),
  HSpacing(1),
  InputField(Id(:search), Opt(:hstretch, :notify), "", "")
)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The search input field receives two options. The first one is related to the
dialog's layout and tells the widget to occupy all the horizontal available
space. The second one is the answer to our mystery. By default, all libYUI
widgets except the buttons can be considered &quot;passive&quot; from the events
point of view. Their purpose is to display information or to allow the user to
enter some data, but they don't generate events visible by Yast::UI.UserInput.
The :notify option can be used to change this behavior, so our search box
generates an input every time its content changes.
</p>

<h3>The arguments dialog</h3>
<p>
QueryDialog is now in charge of displaying most of the widgets that were
cluttering the interface in the past. That means that there is not much
interesting code there from the layout point of view. But there is an important
difference when compared to EntriesDialog - the absence of an event loop. In
this case, the &quot;run&quot; method follows the typical approach from most
YaST dialogs and simply returns a result based on the button pressed by the
user.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
def run
  return nil unless create_dialog

  begin
    case Yast::UI.UserInput
    when :cancel
      false
    when :ok
      true
    else
      raise "Unexpected input #{input}"
    end
  ensure
    Yast::UI.CloseDialog
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Ready to go</h3>
<p>
We are finally happy enough with the mockup, it exposes all the functionality we
originally wanted to have in a way that works in restrictive ncurses
environments. It's time to implement some real functionality, so let's grab a
coffee and prepare for the <a href="step4.html">the fourth step</a>.
