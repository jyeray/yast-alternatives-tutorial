<h2>Joining the pieces</h2>

<h3>It even works!</h3>
<p>
Now we are ready for the last two steps in our development process: turn our mockup
into a real YaST module capable of displaying system information and package the
resulting module in order to install it and distribute it.
</p>
<p>
As usual, let's start fetching the proposed solution by running the following
command in our local copy.
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
git checkout fully_working
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Play a little bit with the result (both as a regular user and as root) before
diving into the code.
</p>

<h3>Separated presentation</h3>
<p>
YaST does not enforce any particular software pattern to structure the code of
complex modules. Moreover, the example journalctl module is intentionally
simple, so we can focus on the YaST characteristics and avoid complex
architectural disquisitions. Even though, we don't want to have code in our
dialogs that is not strictly related to drawing widgets and driving the
interaction with the user and we obviously don't want to mess our Entry and
Query models with presentation logic.
</p>
<p>
In order to keep things tidy, the example code you have just fetched uses
presenters to intermediate between the domain models and the dialogs. Presenters
are a very popular approach to implement the
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/SeparatedPresentation.html">separated
presentation pattern</a> using delegators. Instead of accessing directly to the
domain classes, the dialogs rely on the corresponding presenters for those
classes.
</p>
<p>
Same as other classes in this tutorial, the included unit tests for
EntryPresenter and QueryPresenter are not as exhaustive as they should be and
are offered only as a starting point for writing a more comprehensive suite.
</p>
<p>
Although the usage of presenters is quite common in other development
environments like the Ruby on Rails community, it's not the standard way of
organizing the code in the existing YaST modules. In fact, there is currently
nothing like a &quot;standard way or organizing the code&quot; in YaST. Thus,
if the usage of presenters does not fit your problem or your personal
preferences, feel free to use any other approach.
</p>

<h3>From mockup to reality</h3>
<p>
In the original mockup there was no binding between the widgets and
any real information coming from the system or the user. Now the
EntriesDialog object keeps three instance variables to store that information.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>@query is a QueryPresenter object to keep the filters and associated
    information.</li>
  <li>@entries is an array of EntryPresenter objects fetched by @query
    from the systemd journal.</li>
  <li>@search is the string used to filter the displayed entries, entered by
    the user in the corresponding text input field.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, another subtle but meaningful change has be done by renaming the
client from mockup.rb to journalctl.rb.
</p>

<h3>A more interactive interface</h3>
<p>
As opposed to the mockup, in which the only possible interaction was opening and
closing the dialogs, our module can now react to many events, like shown in
the new event loop.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
def event_loop
  loop do
    case Yast::UI.UserInput
    when :cancel
      # Break the loop
      break
    when :filter
      # The user clicked the filter button
      if read_query
        read_entries
        redraw_query
        redraw_table
      end
    when :search
      # The content of the search box changed
      read_search
      redraw_table
    when :refresh
      # The user clicked the refresh button
      read_entries
      redraw_table
    else
      log.warn "Unexpected input #{input}"
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The loop relies on three private methods to set the value of the instance
variables (unsurprisingly called read_query, read_entries and read_search)
and two methods (redraw_query and redraw_table) to update the user interface.
</p>
<p>
Let start with the latter. The method redraw_table is just a one-liner that uses
the ChangeWidget function to alter the :Items property of the widget with the
identifier :entries_table.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
def redraw_table
  Yast::UI.ChangeWidget(Id(:entries_table), :Items, table_items)
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
As you may have already guessed, the same function can be used not only to
change the list of items in other type of widgets (like a combo box), but also
to change other properties like the status of a widget (:Enabled), its label
(:Label), its content (:Value), the selected item (:CurrentItem) and many more.
</p>
<p>
But sometimes altering an already existing widget is not enough and is better
to fully replace it with something else. That's exactly what redraw_query does
with one of the labels at the top of the dialog.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
def redraw_query
  Yast::UI.ReplaceWidget(Id(:query), query_description)
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
But replacing widgets needs some preparation. ReplaceWidget will only work on a
special type of widget called ReplacePoint which has no visual effect and
whose only purpose is to act as a marker for ReplaceWidget within the widgets
tree, as you can see in the following excerpt from EntriesDialog.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
def create_dialog
  Yast::UI.OpenDialog(
    Opt(:decorated, :defaultsize),
    VBox(
      # Header
      Heading(...),

      # Filters
      Left(...),
      Left(ReplacePoint(Id(:query), query_description)),
      VSpacing(0.3),

      # Log entries
      table,
      VSpacing(0.3),

      # Footer buttons
      HBox(...)
    )
  )
end

def query_description
  Label(@query.filters_description)
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
But besides changing the interface to reflect the changes, we also need to read
the content of the widgets. The simplest example is the read_search method
used to set the value of @search reading it from the corresponding input field.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
def read_search
  @search = Yast::UI.QueryWidget(Id(:search), :Value)
  log.info "Search string set to '#{@search}'"
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The QueryWidget function can be used to check the value of many different
properties. The following method uses it for reading the value of all the
relevant widgets in QueryDialog.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
def query_from_widgets
  boot = Yast::UI.QueryWidget(Id(:boot), :CurrentButton)
  filters = { boot: boot }

  QueryPresenter.additional_filters.each do |filter|
    name = filter[:name]
    # If the checkbox is checked
    if Yast::UI.QueryWidget(Id(name), :Value)
      # Read the widget...
      value = Yast::UI.QueryWidget(Id(:"#{name}_value"), :Value)
      # ...discarding empty values
      filters[name] = value unless value.empty?
    end
  end

  QueryPresenter.new(filters)
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
When the user pushes the &quot;change filter&quot; button, a new 
QueryDialog is opened. When the user pushes the &quot;ok&quot; button, the
dialog uses the function above to construct a new QueryPresenter object that is
then returned and stored in the @query instance variable of the caller.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the code in the proposed solution does not rely in any specific
YaST feature and, thus, it should be pretty straightforward to read and
understand.
</p>
<h3>Show your achievements to the world</h3>
<p>
We finally have a fully working YaST module. It's time to install it in our
system and to release it for others to enjoy and test. Even whether you feel
that your module is not yet ready for production usage, you must never forget
the &quot;release early, release often&quot; principle. The
<a href="step7.html">last step</a> of the tutorial will teach you everything
you need to know in order to ship your YaST modules.
