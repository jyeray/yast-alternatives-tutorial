<h2>Hello world</h2>

<h3>A basic client as a first step</h3>
<p>
Usually, the first step when creating an application with a graphical interface
is drawing some mockups for that interface. It can be done with any available
tool (including good old paper&amp;pencil), but when developing a YaST module
you will always have to take into account the ncurses interface. With that in
mind, maybe using <a href="https://github.com/libyui/libyui">libYUI</a>
(the widget abstraction library used by YaST) to write the mockup is not a bad
idea.
</p>
<p>
As explained in &quot;YaST architecture&quot; at
<a href="http://yast.github.io/documentation.html">the official YaST
documentation page</a>, executing YaST means actually calling a YaST client.
So let's write a client that will draw our mockup.
</p>

<h3>Checkout the initial mockup</h3>
<p>
First of all, let's travel in time to the origin and checkout the initial commit
of the repository.
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
git checkout hello_world
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Browsing the code</h3>
<p>
The repository now contains just a directory called &quot;src&quot; to mimic
the structure described in &quot;YaST code organization description&quot;
at <a href="http://yast.github.io/documentation.html">the documentation</a>.
You will find that directory in every YaST module and you will soon find why.
</p>
<p>
Inside that directory there are only two files: &quot;clients/mockup.rb&quot;
and &quot;lib/journalctl/mockup_dialog.rb&quot;. The first one is mainly
a Ruby script. Whatever code is there, it will be executed right away when
calling the client. Several old YaST modules contain clients with the
functionality implemented in-line. This is now considered harmful since it makes
harder to use automatic test tools. The preferred approach is to encapsulate the
functionality in classes and have minimal clients that simply invoke the methods
on those classes. As you can see, our mockup client simply calls the method
&quot;run&quot; of a MockupDialog object.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
require "journalctl/mockup_dialog"
Journalctl::MockupDialog.new.run
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
All the interesting code for this first &quot;hello world&quot; is in
mockup_dialog.rb, starting with the first two lines.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
require "yast"
Yast.import "UI"
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The first line give you access to all the goodies from
<a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/github/yast/yast-ruby-bindings/">the
YaST Ruby bindings</a>, which includes several cool features that will be used
in this tutorial. To fully understand the second line, you need to know what a
YaST module is. As stated in the architecture document from the
<a href="http://yast.github.io/documentation.html">official YaST
documentation</a>, a module is a YaST component encapsulating functionality
related to a specific area and offering this functionality to other components
through a YCP interface. The method Yast.import loads one of those components
and creates a Ruby object for it in the Yast namespace. That object can then be
used to access the methods and variables provided by the YCP interface of that
module from your Ruby code, no matter in which language the module is written.
One final note, if the module is implemented in Ruby then Yast.import is almost
equivalent to a good old Ruby's &quot;require&quot;, which means that you'll
have full access to the Ruby class defined in the module, not only to methods
published through its YCP interface. The code above imports the UI module, which
is not implemented in Ruby and thus will be used through its published YCP
interface.
</p>
<p>
In the following lines we simply define a Journalctl namespace (for hygienic
reasons) and our class including several mixins provided by the YaST Ruby
bindings.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
module Journalctl
  class MockupDialog
  
    include Yast::UIShortcuts
    include Yast::I18n
    include Yast::Logger
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The first mixin deserves a specific paragraph (see below), the other two should
be obvious enough. Yast::I18n provides methods for internationalization following
the gettext nomenclature and Yast::Logger provides a &quot;log&quot; method
returning an object that can be used to write content in the YaST logs.
</p>
<p>
The first mixin provides several methods to increase the
readability of the code used to define the user interface, but to fully
understand how it works it's convenient to understand the YCP's concept of
&quot;term&quot;. A term is one of the basic data types in the YaST Components
Protocol and the main mechanism to defer the execution of a piece of code. 
The definition of the UI is done using a tree-like structure of YCP terms where
each term represents a function call. For example, the following ruby code
defines a tree of terms that will be translated to the corresponding calls
to libYUI functions when needed.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
content = Yast::Term.new(:VBox,
               Yast::Term.new(:Label, "Say hello..."),
               Yast::Term.new(:PushButton,
                               Yast::Term.new(:Id, :hello),
                               "now!"))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The code above defines a vertical box which contains a label and a button, with
the button being identified by the id :hello. Too much code (and too ugly) for
such a small output. Including the UIShorcuts mixin the same code can be written
as:
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
include Yast::UIShortcuts
content = VBox(
  Label("Say hello..."),
  PushButton(Id(:hello), "now!")
)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Much more readable and clean. The only drawback is that now is easier to forget
that the &quot;content&quot; variable will not contain the result of calling the
VBox function of libYUI, but a tree structure with the function calls (function
names and corresponding arguments) that will be performed while actually drawing
the interface.
</p>
<p>
And last but not least, the MockupDialog contains the &quot;run&quot; method
which relies on several functions from the UI module and the included mixins to
open a dialog, capture the user's input, write that input to the YaST log and
close the dialog. In this example the OpenDialog function receives a term with
the options and another term containing the tree of widgets to draw (which in
this case is a tiny tree with just one label as the only node).
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
def run

  Yast::UI.OpenDialog(
    Opt(:decorated, :defaultsize),
    Label(_("Hello world!"))
  )

  input = Yast::UI.UserInput

  log.info "Received #{input}"

  Yast::UI.CloseDialog
end
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Running the code</h3>
<p>
Sure you cannot wait to see the code in action and most likely you have already
tried to run it before reading this text. Your first attempt would probably be
to use the &quot;rake run&quot; task that we already used during the
introduction. But that will not work because we have not created a proper
Rakefile file yet. So let's forget about the magic for a while and
let's run our mockup client manually by just running this from the root of our
repository:
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
Y2DIR=src/ /usr/sbin/yast2 mockup
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Pretty straightforward, just like invoking any YaST client installed in the
system but using the Y2DIR environment variable to tell YaST to look first into
our src directory when looking for YaST components.
</p>
<p>
Right now, the only possible interaction with our client is closing the dialog.
While doing it, take a look to the file ~/.y2log (or /var/log/YaST/y2log if you
are running the client as the root user) to see what is happening and to
check that our printed message is there.
</p>
<p>
Let's also take a look to how it looks in the ncurses interface.
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
Y2DIR=src/ /usr/sbin/yast2 --ncurses mockup
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Press &quot;esc&quot; to close the dialog and exit. You can see the debugging
output again in ~/.y2log
</p>

<h3>Rejoice!</h3>
